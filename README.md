# Morse Code Translator

https://morse-code-ac.netlify.app/


## Purpose

The purpose of this challenge is to apply Javascript knowledge to create a morse translator. 


## Tech stack
- **Javascript**
- **HTML** 
- **SCSS**


## MVP

- Create a user interface that allows the user to either input some English text or some Morse Code
- Create JS functions that would allow the user to:

  - translate their English text into Morse Code
  - Morse Code into English text

- Make sure to handle spaces properly (ie. there is 1 space between English words, but one space between Morse Code characters)
- Make sure to separate pure JS functions and DOM manipulation

- Add unit testins for each of the pure function that your translator uses (each function should have at least 4 tests, think of edge case, wrong inputs, etc ...)
